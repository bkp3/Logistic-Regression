# Logistic-Regression
 Breast Cancer detection using Logistic Regression<br>
 Detect breast cancer by applying a logistic regression model on a real-world dataset and predict whether a tumor is benign (not breast cancer) or malignant (breast cancer) based off its characteristics.<br><br><br>
 Build a logistic regression model to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant).

Clump thickness<br>

Uniformity of cell size<br>

Uniformity of cell shape<br>

Marginal adhesion<br>

Single epithelial cell<br>

Bare Nuclei<br>

Bland chromatin<br>

Normal nucleoli<br>

Mitoses<br><br><br>

Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
